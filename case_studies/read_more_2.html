                <h2 class="title-text">NUMI Design Drives Global Prediction's UX Transformation</h2>
                <p class="p-text">Global Predictions is a multi-asset net worth management platform that empowers
                    everyday people to become better, smarter investors. Investors are able to view all their assets,
                    understand exposures, minimize risks, and act on personalized recommendations based on their
                    investment preferences, all powered by Global Predictions' proprietary modeling engine.</p>
                <h2 class="title-text">A Difference of Quality</h2>
                <p class="p-text">Alex, CEO and Founder of Global Predictions, had had some experience working with
                    external design companies, but hadn't been satisfied with their quality of work. Alex was open to
                    exploring new design solutions, and appreciated NUMI's comprehensive candidate profiles.

                    “With NUMI I was able to assess five candidates, assess portfolios and book meetings. Very quickly
                    we were able to narrow down to a designer that we felt excited working with.” </p>
                <h2 class="title-text">From MVP to Full Functionality</h2>
                <p class="p-text">NUMI designers worked with the Global Predictions team as they transformed a basic
                    application into something that live users found powerful and delightful. NUMI designers set up
                    Figma systems to organize product rollouts. Alex appreciated the tight feedback loop and rapid
                    response times NUMI designers brought to the project.

                    “He's in our software slack channel. If the Engineering team has questions about the design or edge
                    cases we didn't consider, instead of going through me they can just ask him directly and typically
                    two minutes later there is some update to the design.” </p>
                <h2 class="title-text">Ideas to Implementation</h2>
                <p class="p-text">With a NUMI designer, Alex has the freedom to lay out high level preferences and
                    choose between different design paths as they iterate towards a new feature. This process of
                    iteration continues to improve Global Prediction's user experience.

                    “We've worked with a NUMI designer for the past 8 months, and he's absolutely transformed the user
                    experience of our product. Everything from our public website to the onboarding process to how
                    people actually interact with the app… He's touched basically every part of the design of our
                    product workflow to make it something that users truly appreciate and trust as part of their
                    investing process.”</p>
