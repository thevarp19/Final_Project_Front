                <h2 class="title-text">Mobot Uses NUMI to Save on Design Talent</h2>
                <p class="p-text">Mobot's mechanical robots automate mobile app tests that are impossible for emulators,
                    virtual devices, and existing frameworks. When the stakes are high, Mobot helps their customers ship
                    faster and with confidence, every time.</p>
                <h2 class="title-text">Beginning a Brand Redesign</h2>
                <p class="p-text">Mobot had explored a total rebrand of their site with traditional design agencies and
                    were blown away by the cost. Their team had a really solid idea of where they wanted to go with
                    their rebrand, they just needed “someone to bring that to life.”

                    After exploring the talent marketplace, Mobot found NUMI and were quickly linked up with a talented
                    designer at an affordable price point. </p>
                <h2 class="title-text">Working with a NUMI Designer on Your Team</h2>
                <p class="p-text">Right off the bat Mobot was impressed with their NUMI designer's response rate and
                    organization. “[He's] been a fantastic designer and developer. It's been a very pleasant process.
                    We're able to hash things out with him on the wireframes in Figma and then moving on to the
                    designs.”

                    When working with their NUMI designer, Mobot found a team member fully integrated into their work
                    processes, not a contractor standing on the sidelines. “He's been part of the team: responsive,
                    collaborative, and great to work with. It's been great that he's been available as a resource
                    directly to our CEO and our Director of Strategy, rather than having me as the middle man.” </p>
                <h2 class="title-text">NUMI Designers are Trusted Advisors</h2>
                <p class="p-text">Mobot wasn't looking for a design agency to make all their decisions for them, they
                    had a strong vision for their brand. But Mobot also needed a designer with the confidence to give
                    constructive feedback so they could build the best brand possible. “He takes our feedback in certain
                    areas, but then he knows when to push back. He lets us know 'Hey this is a best practice.' I
                    appreciate that, he's the expert.”</p>
                <h2 class="title-text">Delivering Results with NUMI</h2>
                <p class="p-text">Mobot was able to successfully rebrand their site by working with a seasoned and
                    affordable NUMI designer in a way that will impact their bottom line. “We've gotten multiple
                    positive comments from our investors, our board, it's been really great.”</p>
